//! Theme tokens — STRAND_DESIGN_LANGUAGE.md §6 (Theming) and SHELL_SPEC.md
//! §8 (Theming & density).
//!
//! Three themes: `cockpit-light` (default: dark petrol chrome around light
//! paper), `cockpit-dark` (petrol-black chrome, charcoal paper) and
//! `high-contrast`. Themes are the *only* per-user visual variance. Two
//! densities: `working` (default, hands-density) and `reading`
//! (Notebook/published, looser leading, wider measure) — density affects
//! spacing/type-scale tokens, never colors, so [`ThemeTokens`] itself has no
//! density axis.
//!
//! Chrome (Mast/Bridge/Strip) stays dark petrol regardless of theme — STRAND
//! tenet 1, "Cockpit chrome, daylight work" — which is why `chrome_ink` is
//! identical across `cockpit-light` and `cockpit-dark` below (the chrome
//! ground barely changes; only the paper the model sits on does).
